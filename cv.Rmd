## Work Experience

**Data Analyst Intern — Dizal Pharma · Shanghai, China** *(July 2024 – Aug 2024)*  

- Conducted statistical analyses for CMC and quality management in line with industry regulations.  
- Developed a DOE framework for process control (formulation optimization, stability, expiry assessment).  
- Computed Cpk/Ppk in Minitab on stability data; implemented SPC control charts to assess capability and stability.  
- Performed literature reviews that improved acceptance sampling methodologies and QA practices.

## Research Experience

**Research Assistant — Fudan University** *(Oct 2023 – June 2025 · Advisor: Prof. Boxun Lu)*  

- Explored molecular mechanisms/therapeutics for polyQ and polyG neurodegenerative diseases.  
- Quantified proteins via BCA; profiled expression via Western Blot and ImageJ; performed fluorescence microscopy.  
- Investigated protein distribution/colocalization with immunofluorescence.  
- Measured mRNA levels via RT-qPCR; validated via DNA electrophoresis.  
- Analyzed high-throughput screening data in R.  
- Led an independent project on SCA1 mechanism and potential therapies.

**Research Assistant — University of California, Berkeley** *(June 2023 – Aug 2023 · Advisor: Prof. Sheng Luan)*  

- Studied Arabidopsis signaling: effects of K nutrition on TORC and the CBL-CIPK network.  
- Prepared sterile media; cultivated seedlings to ensure experimental consistency.  
- Applied qPCR to assess gene expression under varying K levels.  
- Analyzed growth outcomes with one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests for height/biomass differences.

## Selected Project

**Screening & Validation of Compounds Modulating Ubiquitination to Rescue SCA1 Pathology**  

- Reviewed polyQ disease mechanisms, focusing on SCA1 and Ataxin-1 in neurodegeneration.  
- Screened 169 compounds via Western Blot to identify modulators of ubiquitination that degrade mutant Ataxin1.  
- Validated dose/time dependencies; built a nonlinear mixed-effects model in R for dose-response and time effects.  
- Used qPCR and ubiquitination assays to show the compound increases ubiquitination levels.  
- Designed in-vitro efficacy tests in patient-derived fibroblasts and fetal mouse Purkinje cells; complemented with mouse behavioral assessments.  
- Analyzed effects with one-way ANOVA + Dunnett’s post hoc; visualized results.
