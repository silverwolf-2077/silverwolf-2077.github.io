We often make plots in data science.

Here's the tidyverse.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here's a dataframe.

```{r}
plot_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 2), 
    y = 1 + 2*x + rnorm(100)
  )
```

Here's a plot. This seems to show

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$ (This is LaTex stuff, not required)

```{r}
plot_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
