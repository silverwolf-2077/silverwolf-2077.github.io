### **Type II Diabetes**

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major global public health problem and accounts for approximately 90%–95% of all diabetes cases among the more than 38 million affected individuals in the United States. As a chronic condition, T2D is associated with substantial morbidity and an average reduction in life expectancy of around ten years. (CDC, 2024)

### **National Prevalence**

Upon data analysis, we condensed the cholesterol risk across different locations in the United States from the **PLACES: Local Data for Better Health** dataset ([sources, part 1](source.html)), identifying key behavioral factors predominantly associated with the risk through correlation analysis.

Read [Prevalence EDA](eda.html) here.

### **Cholesterol-Associated Factors**

After utilizing **NHANCES** dataset ([sources, part 2](source.html)), we made a in-depth [Exploratory Analysis](Exploratory-Analysis.html), and at last we pinpointed the primary influencers of cholesterol and constructed the final [Build Model](model.html) for predicting individual cholesterol levels.
